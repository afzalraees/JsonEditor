*Go to Window-> JSON template Editor to open the Editor window.


*There are three buttons at first, Add New Template, Load JSON, Save Json.


*Add New template Button will open some fields which you can edit, the fields are name, position, rotation, scale and color as stated in the document. Once you are done editing you can click save and view button which will create a panel with the name you entered and two buttons.


*First Button is Instantiate which will create an Image and assign the properties the user entered. The second button is Edit which will take us back to editing our template. There is also a Remove button present on the editing menu and saved menu. This button will remove the template.


*There is also Save JSON and Load JSON Buttons.


*Save JSON is used to save the changes in JSON File and if there is no JSON file and you click save button it will create an empty file json file for you to add elements in it.


*The Load JSON button is there to load the JSON file. Once you close the window or the Unity Editor the JSON Template Editor window will lose all the templates created. But since the templates are saved in JSON file you can use the Load JSON File to navigate to the location of your JSON file and then open it to load all the previously edited templates.
